# My personal system configuration
## i3-gaps window manager
In this repository I have backed up all of my system configuration files and other useful scripts. In case of a clean install or secondary setup, these files may come in handy. The setup is inspired by a r/unixporn post created by a user called icyphox.

### External programs/libraries required for configuring
1. lxappearance
2. polybar

### Recommended programs
1. midnight-commander (mc): A CLI file manager.
2. htop : A CLI task manager/system monitor.
3. neofetch : Fetches system information and outputs to the terminal.
4. urxvt : A lightweight but highly customizable terminal emulator.
5. infinality : A better font renderer.
6. cmus : A CLI music player.
